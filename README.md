# Project Summary #

I started this project after reading the first twelve chapters of *The Rust Programming Language
by Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols, and Chris Krycho, with contributions from the Rust Community* as a way to teach myself Rust concepts.
The original idea was to follow the *minigrep* project to develop a simple *grep*, after that improve it or simply test other
fun subcommands that represent a challenge to code or simply do something fun.

My main objective was to learn new concepts about Rust and programming in general, as a result I tried to avoid AI autocompletion tools or LLM's in order to make the experience as raw as possible.

# TO DO #

- Update this documentation to be a little bit more descriptive.
- Follow The Rust Programming Language project guide.
- Add custom colors (Low Priority).
